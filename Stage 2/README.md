## Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment Analysis in Glioblastoma

**Overview:**
This project focuses on gene expression analysis in glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive forms of brain cancer. The analysis identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and performs functional enrichment to explore the biological pathways involved in glioblastoma progression.

**Project Goals:**
Differential Gene Expression: Identify significantly upregulated and downregulated genes in glioblastoma samples.
Pathway Enrichment: Perform functional enrichment analysis to determine key pathways involved in glioblastoma.
Data Visualization: Create heatmaps and bar plots to visualize gene expression and pathway analysis results.

**Key Files:**
glioblastoma_data.csv: Gene expression data for glioblastoma.
DESeq2_analysis.Rmd: RMarkdown script for data analysis and visualization.
Upregulated_genes_list.csv: List of upregulated genes.
Downregulated_genes_list.csv: List of downregulated genes.
top_20_upregulated_genes.csv: Top 20 upregulated genes.
top_20_downregulated_genes.csv: Top 20 downregulated genes.
enrichment.csv: Pathway enrichment results.

**Technologies Used:**
R: The main programming language used for analysis.
R Packages:
DESeq2 for differential gene expression analysis.
ggplot2 for visualizations.
gplots, dplyr, Amelia for data manipulation and plotting. 

**Conclusion:**
This analysis reveals significant DEGs in glioblastoma and highlights important pathways involved in the disease. These insights can help advance research into targeted therapies and better understanding of glioblastoma biology.
