# **Background**

Neuron-supporting glial cells called astrocytes are the source of the extremely aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma. Fast development and the ability to penetrate and kill nearby healthy brain tissue are two of this cancer's well-known traits. Although it is more commonly diagnosed in older persons, glioblastoma can occur at any age.

The molecular and genetic basis of glioblastoma must be understood because of the disease's severe nature and the difficulties in treating it. Finding highly elevated and downregulated genes will be the goal of this project's analysis of gene expression data from glioblastoma samples. Our objective is to identify critical pathways contributing to the advancement of glioblastoma by functional enrichment analysis. This could facilitate the creation of tailored therapeutics and enhanced approaches to management.

**Read and Prepare the Data set**

```{r Read data, echo=TRUE}

## **Filter Results**

```{r Result, echo=TRUE}

# **Enrichment Analysis**

Enrichment pathways identify which biological pathways are overrepresented among differentially expressed genes in glioblastoma. Gene lists are prepared, enrichment analysis is conducted, and significant pathways are visualized using bar plots to highlight key pathways involved in the disease.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Read pathway enrichment results from a CSV file
Pathway_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/user/Downloads/enrichment.csv")

# View the first few rows to understand the structure
head(Pathway_data)
#Set a threshold for signifiance 
significant_pathways <- Pathway_data %>%
  filter(`Enrichment.FDR` < 0.05)


```
**Visulazation of Enrichment Pathway**
```{r}
ggplot(significant_pathways, aes(x = reorder(`Pathway`, `Fold.Enrichment`), y = `Fold.Enrichment`, fill = `Fold.Enrichment`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top Enriched Pathways",
       x = "Pathway",
       y = "Fold Enrichment") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "darkblue", high = "orange") +
  theme_minimal()

```




# **Conclusion**
